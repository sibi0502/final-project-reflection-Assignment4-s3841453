<h2>Judgments of Purpose</h2>
 <p>The purpose of my project was to explore the use of audio sounds through the use of drawing and creativity. I wanted users to not only see their marks on the canvas but also hear them. I wanted to turn a typically silent activity into a playful, musical experience. I wanted the user to enjoy the process of creating their artwork.</p>

<h2>Judgments of Worth</h2>
<p>The key values I prioritized were accessibility, playfulness, and expressiveness. I wanted the tool to feel intuitive and immediately fun to use, even for those unfamiliar with drawing software or music-making. I made responsiveness a big factor in this design. The users needed to feel like their interactions mattered. Another key value was nostalgia, I wanted to evoke the innocence of early digital creativity through design and sound.</p></section>
<section>
<h2>Judgments of Framing</h2>
<p>I created a browser-based sketchpad with sound. This meant working within the technical constraints of JavaScript, HTML5 canvas, and the Tone.js library for audio. I chose not to include features like saving drawings or exporting sound, as the focus was on short time creativity rather than finished output. These limitations helped me focus on the real-time feedback loop between user action and sensory response.</p>

  <h2>Judgments of Appearance</h2>
  <p>The visual aesthetic took direct inspiration from retro tools like MS Paint and Kid Pix. I used bright and cartoonish UI elements. The style was made to be welcoming and designed to appeal to a sense of fun and nostalgia. The fonts were made to be that of a 90s style game. Overall, the look supports a non-serious, toy-like experience.</p>

  <h2>Judgments of Quality</h2>
   <p>A judgment on the technical side was how to handle real-time audio feedback without overwhelming the user. I used different Tone.js synths for different tools e.g., PolySynth for brush, NoiseSynth for eraser and mapped tool and colour changes to specific musical notes using triggerAttackRelease. I added synth.volume.value = -15 to prevent the colour change sounds from becoming too loud. Envelopes were tweaked for smoother transitions, and sound was only initialized after the first user interaction to comply with browser autoplay policies.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Judgments of Composition</h2>
  <p>The project was designed so that audio, visual and interaction are tightly integrated. The drawing canvas, sound feedback, and retro aesthetic all work together to create a unified experience. The UI is minimal to keep attention on the canvas and sound. I constantly tested the project to ensure it felt balanced, that no one element audio, visuals, or interaction dominated or distracted from the others.</p>
</section>

<section>
 <h2>Judgments of Navigation</h2>
  <p>I prioritized clarity and immediate feedback. Users should understand what to do just by looking at the interface: click, draw, hear. I avoided adding too many tools or options so as not to overwhelm. There is no onboarding or tutorial, instead, the project relies on intuitive exploration. I also chose to delay audio initialization until after the first click to improve user experience and avoid browser audio policy issues.</p>
